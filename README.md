# DNNs as MILP 

Given weights and biases, this repo contains functions to give an equivalent MILP model for the DNN. 

The MILP assumes that all the nodes in the DNN have a ReLU activation function. The model is not valid for other activation functions. 

See the src code for documentation of the function
